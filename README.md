# Integral Approximation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the numerical approximation of integrals using Chebyshev polynomials. It implements and compares the Trapezoidal and Simpson's methods for integral approximation.

## Features
- Implements numerical integration using Trapezoidal and Simpson's methods.
- Utilizes Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind.
- Includes error measurement and optimization techniques.

## Usage
1. Add the project folders to the MATLAB search path.
2. Use provided functions (`trapezoidal`, `simpson`, `chebyshev_combination`) for integral calculations.
3. Explore the GUI application (`examplesGUI.mlapp`) for visual demonstration and error analysis.

## Examples
- Several examples (`chebyshev_example_1`, `chebyshev_example_2`, etc.) are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods in different scenarios.

## Error Analysis
- The project includes a detailed analysis of the errors associated with each method, including heat maps and relative error comparisons.
